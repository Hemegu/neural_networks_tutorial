# neural_networks_tutorial

A series of notebook to learn how Artificial Neural Networks work, with video support.

# 1. Neural Network principles notebook

The [notebook](1. Neural Network principles exercices.ipynb) and [its solution](1. Neural Network principles solutions.ipynb) provide a first touch with the building blocks of low level neural networks.

The video is available [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJu-ZzE3sUo)
